# gotreesitter

Pure-Go [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) runtime. No CGo, no C toolchain. It cross-compiles to any `GOOS`/`GOARCH` target Go supports, including `wasip1`.

```sh
go get github.com/odvcencio/gotreesitter
```

gotreesitter loads the same parse-table format that tree-sitter's C runtime uses. `ts2go` extracts grammar tables from upstream `parser.c` files, compresses them into binary blobs, and deserializes them on first use. 206 grammars ship in the registry.

## Agent Skill

Agents working with gotreesitter should use the [using-gotreesitter](https://github.com/odvcencio/m31labs-skills/blob/main/skills/using-gotreesitter/SKILL.md) skill.

## Motivation

Every Go tree-sitter binding in the ecosystem depends on CGo:

- Cross-compilation needs a C cross-toolchain per target. A build with `GOOS=wasip1`, `GOARCH=arm64` from a Linux host, or any Windows target without MSYS2/MinGW will not link.
- CI images must carry `gcc` and the grammar's C sources. `go install` fails for downstream users without a C compiler.
- The Go race detector, coverage instrumentation, and fuzzer cannot see across the CGo boundary. Bugs in the C runtime or in FFI marshaling stay invisible to `go test -race`.

gotreesitter eliminates the C dependency entirely. The parser, lexer, query engine, incremental reparsing, arena allocator, external scanners, and tree cursor are all implemented in Go. The grammar blob is the only input.

## Quick start

```go
import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/odvcencio/gotreesitter"
    "github.com/odvcencio/gotreesitter/grammars"
)

func main() {
    src := []byte(`package main

func main() {}
`)

    lang := grammars.GoLanguage()
    parser := gotreesitter.NewParser(lang)

    tree, _ := parser.Parse(src)
    fmt.Println(tree.RootNode())
}
```

`grammars.DetectLanguage("main.go")` resolves a filename to the matching `LangEntry`.

### Browser and WebAssembly

The repository ships two `GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm` targets: a blob-loading
runtime, and a grammargen build that imports tree-sitter grammar JSON and
generates tables in the browser. The runtime exposes parsing, queries, and
highlighting; structured parse and query results include both UTF-8 byte
offsets and JavaScript UTF-16 code-unit offsets. It can also retain an
incrementally updated document tree and reuse it for highlights, tags, and
queries. `cmd/wasmassets` emits a reproducible, single-language browser
bundle for either the Go or TinyGo WebAssembly compiler.

See the [WebAssembly guide](wasm/README.md) for build commands, the complete
JavaScript APIs, node and match limits, and a browser example.

### Strict parsing and partial trees

The default parse methods preserve tree-sitter's partial-tree behavior. If a
timeout, cancellation flag, token-source EOF, or parser safety limit stops
the parse early, the returned tree records the stop reason and the error
stays nil. This is useful for editors and diagnostics, where a partial tree
still has value.

Use strict methods when partial output should fail a request:

```go
parser.SetTimeoutMicros(50_000)

tree, err := parser.ParseStrict(src)
if errors.Is(err, gotreesitter.ErrParseStoppedEarly) {
    fmt.Println(tree.ParseStopReason())
}
```

Use work limits to select parser thresholds without a wall-clock deadline:

```go
limits := gotreesitter.ParseWorkLimits{
    IterationLimit:  200_000,
    StackDepthLimit: 8_192,
    NodeLimit:       1_000_000,
}
parser.SetParseWorkLimits(limits)

pool := gotreesitter.NewParserPool(lang,
    gotreesitter.WithParserPoolParseWorkLimits(limits))
```

Positive fields replace the corresponding source-derived threshold. Zero or negative fields keep the default.
The thresholds apply to each production parser loop, including recovery parses. They do not count total operation work or allocated bytes.
The parser checks node and depth thresholds between steps. A step can exceed either threshold before the next check.
Stable parse methods bypass compact and forest speculation while a work limit is configured.
This route change can affect performance and tree selection. Clear all fields to restore normal routing.
Timeouts, cancellation, and memory budgets can still stop a parse first.

The per-parse memory budget grows with the input. It is the larger of 512 MiB
and 512 bytes for each input byte, so valid input does not need a manual
setting. Set a fixed budget to cap parser memory, for example in a service
with a memory limit:

```go
parser.SetMemoryBudgetBytes(256 << 20) // 256 MiB for each parse

pool := gotreesitter.NewParserPool(lang,
    gotreesitter.WithParserPoolMemoryBudgetBytes(256<<20))
```

A budget stop returns a partial tree with `ParseStopMemoryBudget`. A negative
budget turns the per-parse budget off. The process-heap ceiling still stops a
runaway parse. It is the larger of 2 GiB and twice the budget.

A threshold stop returns a partial tree with one of these reasons:

- `ParseStopIterationLimit`
- `ParseStopStackDepthLimit`
- `ParseStopNodeLimit`

Strict variants are available for full parse, incremental parse, token-source
parse, factory parse, `ParseWith`, and `ParserPool`.

`grammars.ParseFilePooledStrict` returns a pooled `*BoundTree` only after a
complete parse. The caller must call `Release` on a returned tree. It returns
`nil` and an error for parser setup failures, parse failures, and early stops.

`Tagger.TagStrict` returns tags only after a complete parse. It releases its
internal tree before it returns. It returns `nil` and an error for parser
failures and early stops.

High-level analysis can use `WithHighlighterTimeoutMicros` or
`WithTaggerTimeoutMicros` to bound parser work. The
`HighlightIncrementalStrict` and `TagIncrementalStrict` methods return the
partial tree together with `ErrParseStoppedEarly` and skip running queries
after an early stop.

### Tree lookup helpers

Use `NodeAtByte` or `NamedNodeAtByte` to turn an editor byte offset into a
syntax node:

```go
node := tree.NamedNodeAtByte(offset)
```

The helpers return the smallest matching descendant and handle exact end-byte
boundaries, so callers do not need to hand-roll a tree walk.

### Code-understanding helpers

For hot indexing paths that need common symbols but not arbitrary tags-query
semantics, compile one `FactProgram` and reuse it across trees:

```go
program, err := gotreesitter.NewFactProgram(lang, gotreesitter.FactAll)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
facts := program.Extract(tree)

enclosing, ok := tree.EnclosingDefinition(offset)
```

The compiled program extracts definitions, calls, heritage edges, and imports
during one tree traversal. The individual `ExtractDefinitionSpans`,
`ExtractCalls`, `ExtractHeritage`, and `ExtractImports` APIs remain available.

These APIs cover common Go, JavaScript, TypeScript/TSX, Python, Starlark, and
Java facts. They skip unsupported languages or ambiguous shapes.

### Taproot DSL harness

The `taproot` package is a small front-end harness for grammargen-backed
DSLs. It caches generated or blob-loaded languages, parses source, returns a
`Walker` with common CST helpers, and reports syntax errors while still
returning the partial root for diagnostics:

```go
root, walker, err := taproot.ParseFromBlob("dsl", blob, buildGrammar, src)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
}
fmt.Println(walker.Type(root))
```

Use `taproot.LanguageFromBlob` when a DSL embeds a generated grammar blob but
still wants a source-grammar fallback during development.

### Queries

```go
q, _ := gotreesitter.NewQuery(`(function_declaration name: (identifier) @fn)`, lang)
cursor := q.Exec(tree.RootNode(), lang, src)

for {
    match, ok := cursor.NextMatch()
    if !ok {
        break
    }
    for _, cap := range match.Captures {
        fmt.Println(cap.Node.Text(src))
    }
}
```

The query engine supports the full S-expression pattern language: structural quantifiers (`?`, `*`, `+`), alternation (`[...]`), field constraints, negated fields, anchor (`!`), and all standard predicates. See [Query API](#query-api).

### Typed query codegen

Generate type-safe Go wrappers from `.scm` query files:

```sh
go run ./cmd/tsquery -input queries/go_functions.scm -lang go -output go_functions_query.go -package queries
```

Given a query like `(function_declaration name: (identifier) @name body: (block) @body)`, `tsquery` generates:

```go
type FunctionDeclarationMatch struct {
    Name *gotreesitter.Node
    Body *gotreesitter.Node
}

q, _ := queries.NewGoFunctionsQuery(lang)
cursor := q.Exec(tree.RootNode(), lang, src)
for {
    match, ok := cursor.Next()
    if !ok { break }
    fmt.Println(match.Name.Text(src))
}
```

Multi-pattern queries generate one struct per pattern with `MatchPatternN` conversion helpers.

### Multi-language documents (injection parsing)

Parse documents with embedded languages (HTML+JS+CSS, Markdown+code fences, Vue/Svelte templates):

```go
ip := gotreesitter.NewInjectionParser()
ip.RegisterLanguage("html", htmlLang)
ip.RegisterLanguage("javascript", jsLang)
ip.RegisterLanguage("css", cssLang)
ip.RegisterInjectionQuery("html", injectionQuery)

result, _ := ip.Parse(source, "html")

for _, inj := range result.Injections {
    fmt.Printf("%s: %d ranges\n", inj.Language, len(inj.Ranges))
    // inj.Tree is the child language's parse tree
}
```

It supports static (`#set! injection.language "javascript"`) and dynamic (`@injection.language` capture) language detection, recursive nested injections, and incremental reparse with child tree reuse.

### Source rewriting

Collect source-level edits and apply them atomically, producing `InputEdit` records for incremental reparse:

```go
rw := gotreesitter.NewRewriter(src)
rw.Replace(funcNameNode, []byte("newName"))
rw.InsertBefore(bodyNode, []byte("// added\n"))
rw.Delete(unusedNode)

newSrc, _ := rw.ApplyToTree(tree)
newTree, _ := parser.ParseIncremental(newSrc, tree)
```

`Apply()` returns both the new source bytes and the `[]InputEdit` records. `ApplyToTree()` is a convenience method that calls `tree.Edit()` for each edit and returns source ready for `ParseIncremental`.

### Incremental reparsing

```go
tree, _ := parser.Parse(src)

// User types "x" at byte offset 42
src = append(src[:42], append([]byte("x"), src[42:]...)...)

tree.Edit(gotreesitter.InputEdit{
    StartByte:   42,
    OldEndByte:  42,
    NewEndByte:  43,
    StartPoint:  gotreesitter.Point{Row: 3, Column: 10},
    OldEndPoint: gotreesitter.Point{Row: 3, Column: 10},
    NewEndPoint: gotreesitter.Point{Row: 3, Column: 11},
})

tree2, _ := parser.ParseIncremental(src, tree)
tree.Release()
defer tree2.Release()
```

Release the old tree and the new tree once each. The new tree can share
nodes with the old tree. `ParseIncremental` updates the parent links of those
shared nodes, so do not read the old tree from another goroutine during the
call. After the call, read the new tree.

`ParseIncremental` walks the old tree's spine, identifies the edit region, and reuses unchanged content by reference. For an admitted clean edit, re-lex/reparse work can stay close to the invalidated region: reuse covers leaf nodes, the unchanged suffix, the untouched root, and unchanged top-level siblings after the edit. Admission for top-level sibling reuse is per node: a fragility bit plus byte-range equality, not a language allowlist.

Parse reuse does not guarantee absolute `O(edit)` work. Length or point changes
also require `Tree.Edit` to update coordinates in affected trailing subtrees.
That maintenance grows with the number of trailing nodes or compact entries
whose coordinates move. Same-length edits with unchanged points avoid that shift.
The compact route also supports bounded nested nonterminal reuse when parser
state, node provenance, and lexer dependency proofs permit it.
The v0.52.0 release disables the unsafe same-length token-invariant shortcut.
Ordinary subtree reuse and no-edit reuse remain available. Restoring the shortcut
requires complete lexical dependency proofs under
[issue #1087](https://github.com/odvcencio/gotreesitter/issues/1087).
The unreleased implementation restores bounded reuse after authenticating earlier
lexical reads and the edited token. Unknown coverage or an exhausted proof
budget requires reparsing. See
[pull request #1093](https://github.com/odvcencio/gotreesitter/pull/1093)
for the restoration and its validation.
External scanners need certification for general old-tree reuse. Unsupported
cases use the legacy full-parse fallback. See the
[per-language incremental scanner matrix](docs/external-scanners.md#incremental-reuse-certification-matrix).

When no edit has occurred, `ParseIncremental` detects the nil-edit on a pointer check and returns in single-digit nanoseconds with zero allocations. It returns the old tree itself and adds a handle to it, so releasing the old tree does not invalidate the result.

### UTF-16 input and editor coordinates

UTF-16 callers can parse Go-native code units or endian-specific byte buffers
without converting offsets by hand. The parser core keeps its canonical UTF-8
view internally, while the returned tree retains the original UTF-16 source
and maps nodes, edits, included ranges, query filters, highlights, tags, and
injections back to UTF-16 code-unit coordinates.

```go
src := utf16.Encode([]rune("1+2"))

parser := gotreesitter.NewParser(lang)
tree, _ := parser.ParseUTF16(src)

rng, _ := tree.UTF16RangeForNode(tree.RootNode())
fmt.Println(rng.StartCodeUnit, rng.EndCodeUnit)

node := tree.DescendantForUTF16Range(0, uint32(len(src)))
_ = node

// Incremental edits can be described in UTF-16 code units.
next := utf16.Encode([]rune("1+3"))
tree.EditUTF16(gotreesitter.UTF16Edit{
    StartCodeUnit:  2,
    OldEndCodeUnit: 3,
    NewEndCodeUnit: 3,
}, next)
tree2, _ := parser.ParseIncrementalUTF16(next, tree)
_ = tree2
```

UTF-16 byte input states its byte order explicitly:

```go
tree, _ := parser.ParseUTF16Bytes(buf, gotreesitter.UTF16LittleEndian)
```

Editor-facing APIs have UTF-16 variants:

```go
q, _ := gotreesitter.NewQuery(`(NUMBER) @number`, lang)
cursor := q.Exec(tree.RootNode(), lang, tree.Source())
cursor.SetUTF16Range(tree, 2, 3)

hl, _ := gotreesitter.NewHighlighter(lang, `(NUMBER) @number`)
highlightRanges := hl.HighlightUTF16(src)

tagger, _ := gotreesitter.NewTagger(lang, `(NUMBER) @name @definition.number`)
tags := tagger.TagUTF16(src)
```

Node byte APIs such as `DescendantForByteRange` still use the tree's
canonical UTF-8 byte offsets. Use `DescendantForUTF16Range`, or convert with
`UTF8ByteForUTF16Offset` when starting from editor UTF-16 offsets.

### Tree cursor

`TreeCursor` maintains an explicit `(node, childIndex)` frame stack. Parent, child, and sibling movement run in O(1) with zero allocations — sibling traversal indexes directly into the parent's `children[]` slice.

```go
c := gotreesitter.NewTreeCursorFromTree(tree)

c.GotoFirstChild()
c.GotoChildByFieldName("body")

for ok := c.GotoFirstNamedChild(); ok; ok = c.GotoNextNamedSibling() {
    fmt.Printf("%s at %d\n", c.CurrentNodeType(), c.CurrentNode().StartByte())
}

idx := c.GotoFirstChildForByte(128)
```

Movement methods: `GotoFirstChild`, `GotoLastChild`, `GotoNextSibling`, `GotoPrevSibling`, `GotoParent`, named-only variants (for example, `GotoFirstNamedChild`), field-based (`GotoChildByFieldName`, `GotoChildByFieldID`), and position-based (`GotoFirstChildForByte`, `GotoFirstChildForPoint`).

Cursors hold direct pointers into tree nodes. Recreate the cursor after `Tree.Release()`, `Tree.Edit(...)`, or an incremental reparse.

### Highlighting

```go
hl, _ := gotreesitter.NewHighlighter(lang, highlightQuery)
ranges := hl.Highlight(src)

for _, r := range ranges {
    fmt.Printf("%s: %q\n", r.Capture, src[r.StartByte:r.EndByte])
}
```

### Tagging

```go
entry := grammars.DetectLanguage("main.go")
lang := entry.Language()

tagger, _ := gotreesitter.NewTagger(lang, entry.TagsQuery)
tags := tagger.Tag(src)

for _, tag := range tags {
    fmt.Printf("%s %s at %d:%d\n", tag.Kind, tag.Name,
        tag.NameRange.StartPoint.Row, tag.NameRange.StartPoint.Column)
}
```

### File outlines

`Outliner` projects a symbol outline from a parsed tree: kind, name, spans, and lexical nesting, from the same tags-query captures `Tagger` uses.

```go
entry := grammars.DetectLanguageByName("go")
lang := entry.Language()
outliner, _ := gotreesitter.NewOutliner(lang, grammars.ResolveTagsQuery(*entry))
symbols, report := outliner.OutlineTree(tree)
for _, sym := range symbols {
    fmt.Println(sym.Kind, sym.Name)
}
```

An ambiguous or unnamed definition is omitted and counted in `report`, never guessed. See [docs/outline.md](docs/outline.md) for the full API, per-language coverage, and the C-oracle differential that guards it.

## Benchmarks

Canonical, linkable performance claims live in [BENCH.md](BENCH.md) — the
real-code full-parse matrix, historical incremental controls, the Go-vs-C
fleet scoreboard, memory receipts, and the methodology that keeps them
honest.

`BenchmarkGoParseFullDFA` calls `Parser.Parse`, requires a complete root, and
releases the materialized tree. Its generated 500-function source is now a
historical straight-LR control, not the representative full-parse headline.
`BenchmarkGoParseCoreDFA` remains a parser-loop diagnostic that suppresses
ordinary tree materialization.

A 2026-07-11 audit found that older versions of `BenchmarkGoParseFullDFA`
called `ParseNoResultCompatibilityBenchmarkOnly`, which also enabled the
no-tree path. The previously published `1.54 ms`, `728 B/op`, and
`7 allocs/op` figures — and v0.24.0's later `978 B/op` and `5 allocs/op`
figures — therefore described parser-core diagnostics, not a full
materialized parse. The project withdrew those headline comparisons. The
corrected historical control later measured 10.907 ms on a pinned quiet
host. A second audit found that this source never forks and that its C
comparison used a different Go grammar from gotreesitter. The project
withdrew the former 1.895x ratio and 29% materialization decomposition
rather than promote them as representative claims.

The replacement canonical matrix freezes four clean, human-authored Go files
spanning 5-236 KiB. They reach 12-18 live stacks and constructed-to-selected
node ratios of 3.65-4.47. Admission requires exact deep parity against one
oracle: upstream tree-sitter v0.25.1 commit `f5afe475…`, tree-sitter-go
commit `2346a3ab…`, compiled with `-O2` into a fingerprinted static C
artifact. The benchmark and parity lanes share those oracle sources and
identity; see [BENCH.md](BENCH.md) for the full contract and fixture hashes.

The first strict materialized real-Go publication receipt, shipped with
v0.37.0, measured **5.481673x C** by equal-fixture geomean and **6.313799x
C** for the fixed-suite sum of medians. Those corrected real-code results,
rather than the withdrawn 1.895x straight-LR comparison, established the
full-parse baseline; [BENCH.md](BENCH.md) records every per-fixture median,
RSS value, and receipt hash.

A strict v0.40.0 production receipt at `1935a42c` measures public
`Parser.Parse` at **4.851050x C** by equal-fixture geomean and **5.472406x
C** by fixed-suite sum of medians, with a **5.608320x C** worst fixture. The
latest clean publication of the separately build-tagged, fail-closed
selected-store candidate, at `ba1ed1bf`, measures **2.685181x C** and
**2.676794x C**, respectively, with a **2.791974x C** worst fixture and zero
timed fallbacks. The measured lifecycle seals the accepted compact payloads
into the indexed selected store, walks them through `SelectedCursor`, and
releases the store. That candidate result is diagnostic: it authenticates
visible `gts-deep-tree-v1` structure for the four clean fresh-full fixtures,
not parser-state metadata, recovery, incremental reuse, included ranges, or
public `Parser.Parse`. See [BENCH.md](BENCH.md) for the paired tables, exact
identities, hashes, and support boundary.

The historical incremental measurements on the same generated 500-function
Go workload were `649 ns` for a one-byte edit and `2.43 ns` for a no-edit
reparse. They remain narrow workload-specific controls. The locked
incremental matrix validates correctness and classifies work, but it does
not establish a general comparative Go/C speed headline.

```sh
# Authenticated real-code Go full-parse lanes:
GOMAXPROCS=1 go test . -run '^$' \
  -bench '^BenchmarkGoParseWarmRealDFA$' \
  -benchmem -count=10 -benchtime=750ms

# Complete locked static-C publication receipt (clean, quiet, Docker host):
bash cgo_harness/pure_c/run_canonical_go_full_parse.sh --core <idle-cpu>

# Build-tagged compact fresh-full candidate (diagnostic, fail-closed):
bash cgo_harness/pure_c/run_canonical_go_full_parse.sh \
  --go-backend candidate --core <idle-cpu>

# Historical straight-LR full parse plus incremental API controls:
GOMAXPROCS=1 go test . -run '^$' \
  -bench 'BenchmarkGoParseFullDFA|BenchmarkGoParseIncrementalSingleByteEditDFA|BenchmarkGoParseIncrementalNoEditDFA' \
  -benchmem -count=10 -benchtime=750ms

# Parser-core attribution only:
GOMAXPROCS=1 go test . -run '^$' \
  -bench '^BenchmarkGoParseCoreDFA$' \
  -benchmem -count=10 -benchtime=750ms
```

Correctness and performance are gated separately. For Go-vs-C real-corpus
timing, see [`cgo_harness/perf_scan`](cgo_harness/perf_scan/README.md); its
ratchet records caveats, timeouts, and resource gaps instead of
extrapolating from this generated-Go microbenchmark.

### Benchmark matrix

For repeatable multi-workload tracking:

```sh
go run ./cmd/benchmatrix --count 10
```

This emits `bench_out/matrix.json` (machine-readable), `bench_out/matrix.md`
(summary), and raw logs under `bench_out/raw/`. The default matrix includes
a bounded, warmed language-family full-parse group, reported with `MB/s` so
you can compare parser throughput across generated source sizes. Use
`--only-family` to isolate that group, `--family-unit-count` to scale it, or
`--no-family` for the narrower Go/editor matrix.

## Supported languages

206 grammars ship in the registry. All 206 produce error-free parse trees on smoke samples. Run `go run ./cmd/parity_report` for current status.

- 119 external scanners (hand-written Go implementations of upstream C scanners)
- 7 hand-written Go token sources (authzed, c, cpp, go, java, json, lua)
- Remaining languages use the DFA lexer generated from grammar tables

### Parse quality

Each `LangEntry` carries a `Quality` field:

| Quality | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `full` | All scanner and lexer components present. Parser has full access to the grammar. |
| `partial` | Missing external scanner. DFA lexer handles what it can; external tokens are skipped. |
| `none` | Cannot parse. |

`full` means the parser has every component the grammar requires. It does
not guarantee error-free trees on all inputs — grammars with high GLR
ambiguity may produce syntax errors on very large or deeply nested
constructs, because of parser safety limits (iteration cap, stack depth cap,
node count cap). These limits scale with input size. Check
`tree.RootNode().HasError()` at runtime.

## Repository layout note: the compat tier

The root package carries about 70 `parser_result_<language>*.go` production files, plus their tests — the
C-faithful result-normalization tier that reshapes raw GLR output into the
exact tree the C runtime selects. It is internal plumbing, oracle-gated per
witness, and it shrinks as certified engine mechanisms subsume shims. See
[docs/compat-tier.md](docs/compat-tier.md).

For a maintainer-oriented map of the full root package, ownership seams,
review-sensitive hotspots, and local artifact policy, see
[docs/repository-map.md](docs/repository-map.md).
The ordered, receipt-driven cleanup program is documented in

- **Full-parse throughput**: the strict materialized real-Go production
  receipt at the v0.40.0 tag target `1935a42c` measures public
  `Parser.Parse` at **4.851050x C** by equal-fixture geomean and
  **5.472406x C** by fixed-suite sum of medians against the exact static
  `-O2` oracle (see [BENCH.md](BENCH.md)); its worst fixture is
  **5.608320x C**. The compact candidate's lower diagnostic ratio is not
  a public-parser claim. The former ~2.1x row used a straight-LR
  synthetic and a different Go grammar, so it stays historical only. The
  locked incremental matrix validates correctness and classifies work,
  but general incremental Go/C performance has no current
  publication-grade headline. Full-parse throughput varies by grammar
  and corpus shape; GLR-heavy code, highly ambiguous languages, and very
  large generated files remain the main performance frontier.
- **GLR safety caps**: the parser enforces iteration, stack depth, and
  node count limits proportional to input size. These prevent
  pathological blowup on grammars with high ambiguity, but they impose
  a ceiling on the maximum input complexity that parses without error.
  The caps are tunable but not removable without risking unbounded
  resource consumption.

## Adding a language

### Optional native Lean grammar

The Lean 4 grammar is an opt-in package during its default-fleet graduation.
It is authored with grammargen's Go domain-specific language (DSL). It does
not import another tree-sitter grammar.

```go
import _ "github.com/odvcencio/gotreesitter/grammars/lean"
```

The import registers `.lean`, `lean`, and `lean4` detection. Direct users can
call `lean.Language()` instead. The package includes highlights, outline tags,
and a Go scanner for nested comments.

Lean modules can extend their parser at runtime. The fixed grammar gives core
declarations stable nodes and preserves extension-specific lines as
`custom_command` nodes.

> Adding a language to your own project does **not** require forking this
> repo or following the in-tree steps below. See
> [docs/authoring-languages.md](docs/authoring-languages.md) for the
> out-of-tree pipeline (grammar.json → blob → `LoadLanguage` /
> `RegisterExtension`) and
> [docs/external-scanners.md](docs/external-scanners.md) for external
> scanners in Go. The steps below are for grammars embedded in this repo.

1. Add the grammar repo to `grammars/languages.manifest`
2. Refresh pinned refs in `grammars/languages.lock`:
   `go run ./cmd/grammar_updater -lock grammars/languages.lock -write -report grammars/grammar_updates.json`
3. Generate tables: `go run ./cmd/ts2go -manifest grammars/languages.manifest -outdir ./grammars -package grammars -compact=true`
4. Add smoke samples to `cmd/parity_report/main.go` and `grammars/parse_support_test.go`
5. Verify: `go run ./cmd/parity_report && go test ./grammars/...`

## Grammar lock updates

- `grammars/languages.lock` stores pinned refs for grammar update + parity automation.
- `cmd/grammar_updater` refreshes refs and emits a machine-readable report.
- `.github/workflows/grammar-lock-update.yml` opens scheduled/dispatch update PRs.
- Hand-written scanner ports can also declare `ExternalScannerSpec` metadata
  with upstream source hashes and external-token names. When a grammar update
  changes `src/scanner.c` or the external-token list, treat it as scanner
  work: update the Go scanner binding/port before replacing generated blobs.
  A grammar JSON-only change with unchanged externals can usually follow the
  normal `grammar.json -> grammargen Go DSL -> blob -> parity` path.

Manual refresh:

```sh
go run ./cmd/grammar_updater \
  -lock grammars/languages.lock \
  -allow-list grammars/update_tier1_core100.txt \
  -max-updates 10 \
  -write \
  -report grammars/grammar_updates.json
```

## Architecture

gotreesitter is a ground-up reimplementation of the tree-sitter runtime in Go. No code is shared with, or translated from, the C implementation.

**Parser** — Table-driven LR(1) with GLR fallback. When a `(state, symbol)` pair maps to multiple actions in the parse table, the parser forks the stack and explores all alternatives in parallel. Stack merging collapses equivalent paths. Safety limits (iteration count, stack depth, node count) scale with input size and prevent runaway exploration on ambiguous grammars.

**Incremental engine** — Walks the previous tree and reuses unchanged content
by reference. Reuse includes unchanged top-level siblings and bounded nested
nonterminals with authenticated compact dependency proofs. Length or point changes
still require coordinate updates in affected trailing subtrees. This is not an
absolute `O(edit)` guarantee. The v0.52.0 release disables the unsafe same-length
token-invariant shortcut while preserving ordinary subtree reuse and no-edit reuse.
The unreleased implementation restores this shortcut with authenticated lexical dependencies.
[Pull request #1093](https://github.com/odvcencio/gotreesitter/pull/1093) closed
[issue #1087](https://github.com/odvcencio/gotreesitter/issues/1087).
General reuse with external scanners requires explicit certification, with
boundary checkpoints where configured. Uncertified cases use the legacy
full-parse fallback documented in the
[scanner matrix](docs/external-scanners.md#incremental-reuse-certification-matrix).

**Lexer** — Two paths. `ts2go` generates a DFA lexer from the grammar's lex tables, and it handles most languages. For grammars where the DFA is not enough (for example, Go's automatic semicolons, or YAML's indentation-sensitive structure), hand-written Go token sources implement the `TokenSource` interface directly.

**External scanners** — 119 registered grammars require external scanners for context-sensitive tokens.
Each scanner implements the grammar's `ExternalScanner` interface: `Create`, `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, and `Scan`.
Certified checkpoint-enabled scanners save state at external-token boundaries for incremental reuse.
Uncertified changed-edit cases use a fresh production parse.
The v0.52.0 release disables the former same-length token-invariant exception.
See the [per-language matrix](docs/external-scanners.md#incremental-reuse-certification-matrix) for certification and fallback behavior.

**Arena allocator** — Nodes are allocated from slab-based arenas to reduce GC pressure. Arenas are released in bulk when a tree is freed.

**Query engine** — S-expression pattern compiler with predicate evaluation and streaming cursor iteration. It supports all standard tree-sitter predicates (`#eq?`, `#match?`, `#any-of?`, `#has-ancestor?`, and similar predicates) and directive annotations (`#set!`, `#offset!`, `#select-adjacent!`, `#strip!`).

**Injection parser** — Orchestrates multi-language parsing. It runs injection queries against a parent tree to find embedded regions, spawns child parsers with `SetIncludedRanges()`, and recurses for nested injections. Incremental reparse reuses unchanged child trees.

**Rewriter** — Collects source-level edits (replace, insert, delete) targeting byte ranges, applies them atomically, and produces `InputEdit` records for incremental reparse. It validates edits for non-overlap and applies them in a single pass.

**Grammar loading** — `ts2go` extracts parse tables, lex tables, field maps, symbol metadata, and external token lists from upstream `parser.c` files. These are serialized to compressed binary blobs under `grammars/grammar_blobs/` and lazy-loaded through `loadEmbeddedLanguage()` with an LRU cache. String and transition interning reduce memory footprint across loaded grammars. Grammargen-backed blobs use the same CLI surface; for example, you can regenerate the Go blob with `go run ./cmd/grammargen -lr-split -bin grammars/grammar_blobs/go.bin go`. When loading a raw blob yourself, prefer `grammars.LoadLanguage(name, blob)` over `gotreesitter.LoadLanguage(blob)`, so the runtime attaches the registered external scanner and external lex-state support for that language automatically.

**Standalone grammars** — Import `grammars/<name>` to select a grammar without
the aggregate catalog. All 206 blob-backed grammars provide this API.
These packages work with ordinary `go install` and need no build tags.

```go
import python "github.com/odvcencio/gotreesitter/grammars/python"

parser := gotreesitter.NewParser(python.Language())
```

The linker retains only the selected grammar blobs. The shared `grammars/runtime`
package supplies scanners, decoder repairs, cache controls, and exact runtime profiles.
For example, import `grammars/javascript` and call `javascript.Language()` for JavaScript.
Use the alias `golang` for the `grammars/go` package.

The native `grammars/lean` package also avoids the aggregate catalog.
Import both Lean and `grammars` when you need automatic `.lean` detection.
Existing aggregate imports and build tags remain supported.
When both APIs are imported, the aggregate catalog selects the shared blob source.
This preserves external blob configuration and its errors.

Regenerate package wrappers after you add or update a blob:

```sh
go run ./cmd/gen_grammar_packages
go run ./cmd/gen_grammar_packages -check
```

### Build tags and environment

**External grammar blobs** (avoid embedding in the binary):

```sh
go build -tags grammar_blobs_external
GOTREESITTER_GRAMMAR_BLOB_DIR=/path/to/blobs  # required
GOTREESITTER_GRAMMAR_BLOB_MMAP=false           # disable mmap (Unix only)
```

**Curated language set** (smaller binary):

```sh
go build -tags grammar_set_core  # curated Core100 embedded grammar set
GOTREESITTER_GRAMMAR_SET=go,json,python  # runtime restriction
```

**Selective embedded grammars** (smallest self-contained binary — pick exactly the languages you ship):

```sh
# Embeds ONLY go.bin + java.bin into the binary (everything else is dropped at
# link time). No GOTREESITTER_GRAMMAR_BLOB_DIR needed — still a single static binary.
go build -tags 'grammar_subset grammar_subset_go grammar_subset_java'
```

Add one `grammar_subset_<lang>` tag per grammar you need (names match the
blob file: `grammar_subset_c_sharp`, `grammar_subset_python`, and so on). A
single-language build drops from ~24MB to a few MB. This is finer-grained
than `grammar_set_core` (a fixed set) and, unlike `grammar_blobs_external`,
it keeps the blobs embedded. Pairing `grammar_subset` with
`grammar_blobs_external` instead loads the selected blobs from
`GOTREESITTER_GRAMMAR_BLOB_DIR` at runtime (no embedded blobs at all).

> The four embedding modes are mutually exclusive at the build-tag level:
> default (all embedded) · `grammar_set_core` (Core100 embedded) ·
> `grammar_subset` + `grammar_subset_<lang>` (selected embedded) ·
> `grammar_blobs_external` (none embedded). Regenerate the per-language embed
> files after adding a grammar with `go run ./cmd/gen_subset_blob_embeds`.

**Grammar cache tuning** (long-lived processes):

```go
grammars.SetEmbeddedLanguageCacheLimit(8)    // LRU cap
grammars.UnloadEmbeddedLanguage("rust.bin")  // drop one
grammars.PurgeEmbeddedLanguageCache()        // drop all

fmt.Println(lang.Size())                      // approximate decoded table bytes
```

```sh
GOTREESITTER_GRAMMAR_CACHE_LIMIT=8       # LRU cap via env
GOTREESITTER_GRAMMAR_IDLE_TTL=5m         # evict after idle
GOTREESITTER_GRAMMAR_IDLE_SWEEP=30s      # sweep interval
GOTREESITTER_GRAMMAR_COMPACT=true        # loader compaction (default)
GOTREESITTER_GRAMMAR_STRING_INTERN_LIMIT=200000
GOTREESITTER_GRAMMAR_TRANSITION_INTERN_LIMIT=20000
```

**GLR stack cap override**:

```sh
GOT_GLR_MAX_STACKS=8  # overrides default GLR stack cap (default: 8)
```

The default is tuned for correctness. Increase it only if a grammar or
workload needs more GLR alternatives to preserve parity.

**Legacy benchmark compatibility only**:

```sh
GOT_PARSE_NODE_LIMIT_SCALE=3
```

`GOT_PARSE_NODE_LIMIT_SCALE` is needed only for comparisons against older
truncation-prone benchmark baselines. Keep it unset on current branches.

## Testing

```sh
bash cgo_harness/docker/run_single_grammar_parity.sh typescript
```

For local correctness/parity work, prefer isolated one-language Docker runs:

```sh
# Real-corpus parity for one grammar
bash cgo_harness/docker/run_single_grammar_parity.sh typescript

# Focused grammargen real-corpus lane for one language
bash cgo_harness/docker/run_grammargen_focus_targets.sh --mode real-corpus --langs typescript

# Focused grammargen-vs-C lane for one language
bash cgo_harness/docker/run_grammargen_focus_targets.sh --mode cgo --langs typescript
```

`run_grammargen_focus_targets.sh` is the safest local lane for high-value
grammars: it runs one grammar per container and defaults to a
single-worker profile (`--cpus 1`, `--pids 512`, `GOMAXPROCS=1`,
`GOFLAGS=-p=1`).

For Fortran, both real-corpus runners also default to a tighter bounded
local preset unless you explicitly override it or pass
`--unsafe-fortran-defaults`: `--memory 3g`, `--cpus 1`, `--pids 512`,
`GOMAXPROCS=1`, `GOFLAGS=-p=1`, `GOT_LALR_LR0_CORE_BUDGET=160000000`, and
`GTS_GRAMMARGEN_REAL_CORPUS_GENERATE_TIMEOUT=15m`.

If you only need a fast package-local regression check, keep it in Docker
and narrow the `-run` regex:

```sh
bash cgo_harness/docker/run_parity_in_docker.sh \
  -- "cd /workspace && go test ./grammargen -run '^TestTypeScriptConditionalTypeParity$' -count=1"
```

Avoid `go test ./...` and host-side multi-language or race sweeps on
developer machines while chasing OOMs. Use CI or a dedicated container when
you need broader race coverage.

Other focused correctness/parity commands:

```sh
# Top-50 smoke correctness for the grammars package only
bash cgo_harness/docker/run_parity_in_docker.sh \
  -- "cd /workspace && go test ./grammars -run '^TestTop50(ParseSmokeNoErrors|CorrectnessListMatchesLockFile)$' -count=1 -v"

# Top-50 grammargen import/parity registry coverage
bash cgo_harness/docker/run_parity_in_docker.sh \
  -- "cd /workspace && go test ./grammargen -run '^TestTop50GrammarImportParityCoverage$' -count=1 -v"

# C-oracle parity suites inside the cgo harness
bash cgo_harness/docker/run_parity_in_docker.sh \
  --run '^TestParityFreshParse$|^TestParityHasNoErrors$|^TestParityIssue3Repros$|^TestParityGLRCanaryGo$'
bash cgo_harness/docker/run_parity_in_docker.sh \
  --run '^TestParityCorpusFreshParse$'
```

CI may still run broader race coverage on hosted runners. Do not copy those
commands onto a developer host during OOM diagnosis.

Test suite covers: smoke tests (206 grammars), golden S-expression snapshots, highlight query validation, query pattern matching, incremental reparse correctness, error recovery, GLR fork/merge, injection parsing, source rewriting, and fuzz targets.

## Roadmap

The current release is **v0.53.0**.

Eligible fresh parses use the compact parser by default, with legacy fallback
for unsupported cases. This release fixes public API contract faults and
C-parity gaps found by a repository audit:

- One timeout deadline for each parse, across the compact and production routes.
- Safe tree handles: a stale `Release` does nothing, and an unchanged
  incremental parse no longer invalidates its result when the caller releases
  the old tree.
- Incremental reuse that is correct for multi-edit sequences and changed
  included ranges.
- A default memory budget that grows with the input size.
- Reserved-word keyword promotion as in C, for six grammars.
- Query predicates that check every node of a quantified capture.

These changes do not complete compact parser graduation.

Keep benchmark results, profiles, and source snapshots outside the repository.
Publish reproducible evidence in pull requests or external artifacts.

Publication still requires the mandatory gates in
[the release checklist](docs/releasing.md#release-checklist).
The owner approved only the dated
[v0.52.0](docs/releasing.md#v0520-only-tag-creation-exception) and
[v0.53.0](docs/releasing.md#v0530-only-tag-creation-exception)
tag-creation exceptions.

Detailed shipped evidence lives in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Standard minor
releases may ship on any day after the exact commit on `main` passes the full
hosted continuous integration workflow. Require complete correctness and
performance evidence; do not use a calendar delay as a replacement for release
evidence. The immutable-tag process and urgent-patch exception are documented in
[docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).

### Now — cleanup, ownership, and explainability

- Correctness, portability, and supported parser depth are banked. Preserve
  their receipts and keep correctness gates distinct from the currently
  advisory performance gates.
- Prioritize repository maintenance: remove obsolete experiments and
  telemetry, reduce duplication, clarify subsystem ownership, improve
  documentation, and keep ownership receipts current.
- Retire result-normalization shims only after the authoritative parser,
  scanner, materializer, or incremental mechanism owns the behavior and the
  required route receipts prove the shim inert. Follow the
  [compat-tier retirement guide](docs/compat-tier.md) for the mechanical
  retirement contract.
- Keep the authenticated public benchmarks as regression signals and preserve
  their historical claims. Parser-core, no-tree, compact-candidate, and
  synthetic lanes remain diagnostic rather than public performance claims.
- After cleanup, the next major performance milestone is public
  `Parser.Parse` at no more than **1.5x C** on the locked canonical real-code
  benchmark. It is a future target, not a current gate or achieved result.

### Measured memory boundary

- A production frozen-tree store remains closed by the current measurements:
  whole-tree conversion does not recover enough full-parse time and
  regresses incremental reuse. Do not treat pointer-light migration as an
  authorized next step without new evidence that clears those gates.
- Bounded semispace retention, earlier reclamation of unselected
  construction debris, and tighter parser-budget-to-process-RSS behavior
  remain viable experiments. Each must preserve query, cursor, and
  incremental semantics.

### Deferred — Go-native experience and broader architecture

- Context-aware `Engine`/`ParseRequest`, typed limits and stop reasons,
  immutable registries/profiles, and internal pooling/diagnostic modes.
- `Document`/`Snapshot` ownership for edits, changed ranges, cached queries,
  highlights, tags, injections, and release lifetimes.
- Changed-range analysis plans, a provenance-rich sectioned grammar bundle,
  stronger scanner conformance tooling, and measured optional AOT tiers.
