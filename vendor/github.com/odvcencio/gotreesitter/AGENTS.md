## Agent Workflow: GLR Parity + Performance

This file defines how agents should work in this repo.

### 1) Non-negotiables
- Use `scripts/canopy_query.sh` for cached structural searches and analyses.
- Use direct `canopy ... --no-cache` commands for narrow searches of changed files.
- Use `rg` for literal text. Plain `canopy search grep` patterns start structural parsing.
- Scope structural Canopy searches to the smallest useful path.
- Apply `--limit` to structural searches.
- Do not run concurrent repository-wide Canopy searches.
- The query wrapper detects changed, missing, and new source files.
- The query wrapper uses a fresh scoped query when the cache is stale.
- Run `scripts/refresh_canopy_index.sh` before a broad search when the source set changed.
- The refresh script promotes its temporary cache only after a successful build and validation.
- Do not run repo-wide `go test ./...` or `go test ./... -race` on the host. Broad host sweeps can OOM developer machines and make attribution harder.
- For heavy correctness, parity, or race coverage, use Docker isolation only and keep runs to one language/grammar at a time.
- Keep correctness gating separate from performance gating.
- Prefer reproducible runs over ad-hoc spot checks.
- When chasing an OOM, keep narrowing the workload until one language and one suite remain.

### 2) Correctness Gate (must stay green)
Run before and after performance changes:
- Focused package/unit tests inside Docker, scoped with `-run` whenever possible.
- Parity-focused Docker suites under `cgo_harness`, one language at a time.

When you change GLR/incremental logic, validate parity first, then validate performance.

### 3) Standard Perf Loop
Use this loop for optimization work:
1. Baseline with stable settings.
2. Make one focused change.
3. Re-run the same benchmarks.
4. Keep changes only if `benchstat` improves target metrics without correctness regressions.

Stable settings:
- `GOMAXPROCS=1`
- `-count=1` per process
- one process per explicit shuffle seed
- 20 shuffle seeds by default
- `-benchtime=750ms`
- `-benchmem`

Use `scripts/run_randomized_benchmarks.sh` for every before-and-after
comparison. Do not use a fixed-order benchmark run as comparison evidence.

Primary bench trio:
- `BenchmarkGoParseFullDFA`
- `BenchmarkGoParseIncrementalSingleByteEditDFA`
- `BenchmarkGoParseIncrementalNoEditDFA`

### 4) Metrics and Targets
Track at minimum:
- `ns/op`
- `B/op`
- `allocs/op`
- Max RSS on large-file runs (`/usr/bin/time -v`)

Release-blocking performance safety requirements:
- Do not permit a crash, an out-of-memory failure, or runaway memory retention.
- Preserve the parser memory-budget contracts.
- Complete the benchmark suite and publish reproducible evidence.

Directional performance goals:
- Full parse: within `2x` of C/cgo baseline on agreed macro workload.
- Incremental single-byte edits: at or better than C/cgo baseline.
- Improve `ns/op`, `B/op`, allocation count, and maximum resident set size.

The directional goals do not block a merge or a release. Record each
regression and explain its tradeoff. Continue the optimization work after the
release when correctness, portability, and depth justify the change.

### 5) Attribution for Incremental Hot Path
When profiling incremental edits, split attribution into:
- `Tree.Edit(edit)`
- reuse-cursor/reuse-selection work
- reparse/rebuild work

Use profiled runs to decide whether the next win comes from:
- reuse/invalidation scope,
- GLR/recovery/materialization cost,
- or allocator sizing/retention.

### 6) Commit Discipline
- Keep commits scoped and bisectable.
- Drop scratch/debug artifacts before commit.
- Use project commit flow:
  - `git add ...`
  - `buckley commit --yes --minimal-output`

### 7) Gate Presets
Correctness preset:
- `bash cgo_harness/docker/run_parity_in_docker.sh -- "cd /workspace && go test ./grammargen -run '^TestName$' -count=1"` for the smallest regression that covers the change
- `bash cgo_harness/docker/run_single_grammar_parity.sh <grammar>`
- `bash cgo_harness/docker/run_grammargen_focus_targets.sh --mode real-corpus --langs <language>`
- `bash cgo_harness/docker/run_grammargen_focus_targets.sh --mode cgo --langs <language>`
- Do not batch multiple languages together while diagnosing regressions or OOMs.

Race preset:
- CI or dedicated-container only.
- Do not run host-side repo-wide race sweeps while diagnosing OOMs.

Perf preset (stable settings):
- `bash scripts/run_randomized_benchmarks.sh --output /tmp/gotreesitter-bench.txt`

Full-parse non-truncation probe:
- `GOT_PARSE_NODE_LIMIT_SCALE=3` may be used for diagnostic full-parse runs when default node budget truncates benchmark/parity cases.
- `GOT_GLR_MAX_STACKS=...` overrides the default GLR stack cap of 8.

### 8) Prose Standard: ASD-STE100
All agent-written prose in this repo follows the ASD-STE100 rules
profile (decision 0011, hypha://m31labs/hyphae).

- Use the active voice and the imperative mood for instructions.
- Keep procedural sentences at or below 20 words. Keep descriptive
  sentences at or below 25 words.
- Give each word one meaning. Use it the same way through the
  document.
- Do not write noun clusters of more than three nouns. Do not drop
  articles.
- Do not use idioms, slang, or Latin abbreviations. Write "for
  example", not "e.g.".
- Define an abbreviation at first use.
- Use a vertical list for more than two items or steps.
- Use concrete verbs. Avoid "handle", "leverage", "deal with".

Scope: commit messages, PR titles and bodies, review output, and all
documentation prose that agents write. Code identifiers and quoted
tool output are out of scope.
