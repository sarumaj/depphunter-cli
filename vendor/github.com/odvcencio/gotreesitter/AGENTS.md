## Agent Workflow: GLR Parity + Performance

This file defines how agents should work in this repo.

### v1 design

The owner's [v1 design](docs/v1-design.md) governs engine work and supersedes conflicting campaign guidance.
The full design is `hypha://m31labs/gotreesitter/specs/spec.gotreesitter-v1-design`.
Keep one active pull request (PR) per lane:

- Core: `sched`, `gss`, and `recover`.
- Incremental: `incr`.
- Output: `tree` and `compat`.
- Legacy fixes: Q items.

PRs that change only graduation allowlists and receipts do not occupy the core lane.
Add no language-name comparisons in engine files (D6). Start new engine code in `internal/` (D9).
Require incremental parsing to equal fresh Go parsing (D8). Use a fresh parse wherever this invariant remains unproven.
Check deterministic counters before randomized timing (D10). Work counters must not rise; reuse counters must not fall.
Put before-and-after counters in every engine PR body. Apply the design's 2% ledger threshold.

Run the invariant gate for every language that an engine PR can affect:

- Incremental parsing equals fresh parsing at every edit-session step.
- An `ERROR` root implies `HasError()`.
- The root covers the input, or the stop reason explains the gap.
- A reparse without edits allocates nothing.

Graduate each language through the allowlist after the E-A exit gate.
Flip the global default only after all top-50 languages graduate, and only in a release candidate (D7).
Keep O-Q1 through O-Q7 open. Q0 requires O-Q4. Keep section 8 while O11 awaits the owner.

### 1) Non-negotiables
- Use `scripts/canopy_query.sh` for cached structural searches and analyses.
- Use direct `canopy ... --no-cache` commands for narrow searches of changed files.
- Use `rg` for literal text. Plain `canopy search grep` patterns start structural parsing.
- Scope structural Canopy searches to the smallest useful path.
- Apply `--limit` to structural searches.
- Do not run concurrent repository-wide Canopy searches.
- The query wrapper detects changed, missing, and new source files.
- The query wrapper uses a fresh scoped query when the cache is stale.
- Run `scripts/refresh_canopy_index.sh` before a broad search when the source set changed.
- The refresh script promotes its temporary cache only after a successful build and validation.
- Do not run repo-wide `go test ./...` or `go test ./... -race` on the host. Broad host sweeps can OOM developer machines and make attribution harder.
- For heavy correctness, parity, or race coverage, use Docker isolation only and keep runs to one language/grammar at a time.
- Keep correctness gating separate from performance gating.
- Prefer reproducible runs over ad-hoc spot checks.
- When chasing an OOM, keep narrowing the workload until one language and one suite remain.

### 2) Correctness Gate (must stay green)
Run before and after performance changes:
- Focused package/unit tests inside Docker, scoped with `-run` whenever possible.
- Parity-focused Docker suites under `cgo_harness`, one language at a time.

When you change GLR/incremental logic, validate parity first, then validate performance.

### 3) Standard Perf Loop
Use this loop for optimization work:
1. Baseline with stable settings.
2. Make one focused change.
3. Pass correctness and invariant gates, then compare deterministic counters.
4. Re-run the same randomized benchmarks and compare results with `benchstat`.
5. Apply the [v1 hard gates and ratchets](docs/v1-design.md#performance-gate-one-language). Record directional regressions and their tradeoffs.

Stable settings:
- `GOMAXPROCS=1`
- `-count=1` per process
- one process per explicit shuffle seed
- 20 shuffle seeds by default
- `-benchtime=750ms`
- `-benchmem`

Use `scripts/run_randomized_benchmarks.sh` for every before-and-after
comparison. Do not use a fixed-order benchmark run as comparison evidence.

Primary bench trio:
- `BenchmarkGoParseFullDFA`
- `BenchmarkGoParseIncrementalSingleByteEditDFA`
- `BenchmarkGoParseIncrementalNoEditDFA`

### 4) Metrics and Targets
Track at minimum:
- `ns/op`
- `B/op`
- `allocs/op`
- Max RSS on large-file runs (`/usr/bin/time -v`)

Release-blocking performance safety requirements:
- Do not permit a crash, an out-of-memory failure, or runaway memory retention.
- Preserve the parser memory-budget contracts.
- Complete the benchmark suite and publish reproducible evidence.

Use the [v1 performance gate](docs/v1-design.md#performance-gate-one-language)
for hard failures and per-language ratchets.
Track work counters and reuse counters before timing.
D13 defines three target layers:

- An engine floor for all 206 grammars.
- Tuned targets for the top 50.
- Stretch targets for the top 20.

The `2x` full-parse goal and edits at or below C apply to the top-20 stretch layer.
O-Q3 remains open; do not make the proposed v1.0 speed targets release-blocking without the owner's decision.
Hard failures and ratchets remain mandatory. Record every directional regression and explain its tradeoff.

### 5) Attribution for Incremental Hot Path
When profiling incremental edits, split attribution into:
- `Tree.Edit(edit)`
- reuse-cursor/reuse-selection work
- reparse/rebuild work

Use profiled runs to decide whether the next win comes from:
- reuse/invalidation scope,
- GLR/recovery/materialization cost,
- or allocator sizing/retention.

### 6) Commit Discipline
- Keep commits scoped and bisectable.
- Drop scratch/debug artifacts before commit.
- Use project commit flow:
  - `git add ...`
  - `buckley commit --yes --minimal-output`

### 7) Gate Presets
Correctness preset:
- `bash cgo_harness/docker/run_parity_in_docker.sh -- "cd /workspace && go test ./grammargen -run '^TestName$' -count=1"` for the smallest regression that covers the change
- `bash cgo_harness/docker/run_single_grammar_parity.sh <grammar>`
- `bash cgo_harness/docker/run_grammargen_focus_targets.sh --mode real-corpus --langs <language>`
- `bash cgo_harness/docker/run_grammargen_focus_targets.sh --mode cgo --langs <language>`
- Do not batch multiple languages together while diagnosing regressions or OOMs.

Race preset:
- CI or dedicated-container only.
- Do not run host-side repo-wide race sweeps while diagnosing OOMs.

Perf preset (stable settings):
- `bash scripts/run_randomized_benchmarks.sh --output /tmp/gotreesitter-bench.txt`

Full-parse non-truncation probe:
- `GOT_PARSE_NODE_LIMIT_SCALE=3` may be used for diagnostic full-parse runs when default node budget truncates benchmark/parity cases.
- `GOT_GLR_MAX_STACKS=...` overrides the default GLR stack cap of 8.

### 8) Prose Standard: ASD-STE100
All agent-written prose in this repo follows the ASD-STE100 rules
profile (decision 0011, hypha://m31labs/hyphae).

- Use the active voice and the imperative mood for instructions.
- Keep procedural sentences at or below 20 words. Keep descriptive
  sentences at or below 25 words.
- Give each word one meaning. Use it the same way through the
  document.
- Do not write noun clusters of more than three nouns. Do not drop
  articles.
- Do not use idioms, slang, or Latin abbreviations. Write "for
  example", not "e.g.".
- Define an abbreviation at first use.
- Use a vertical list for more than two items or steps.
- Use concrete verbs. Avoid "handle", "leverage", "deal with".

Scope: commit messages, PR titles and bodies, review output, and all
documentation prose that agents write. Code identifiers and quoted
tool output are out of scope.
